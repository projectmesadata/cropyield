"""PCSE configuration file for WOFOST Water-limited Production simulation
in PCSE including the effect of winter-kill in wheat.

This configuration file defines the soil, crop and agromanagement
components that should be used for water-limited production simulation for
situations with winter-kill.

The winterkill module has been developed within the FP7-MOCCCASIN project
and has  been tested for winter-wheat in W-Russia although it is probably
suitable for other winter-cereals as well.
